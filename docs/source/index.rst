Welcome to anesplot's documentation!
#####################################

anesthPlot is a python package developped to extract, manipulate and plots **anesthesia data
recorded during equine anesthesia**.
Is is using recording generated by the Monitor Software or the Taphonius equine anesthesia machine.

The main purpose is an usage in a **teaching environment** (briefing-debriefing approach),
but this package can also facilite recording manipulation for other purposes.

.. warning::

  This is a work in progres,

   * the processes are mainly focused on horses anesthesia (default values)
   * in our environment the data recorded came from either:

      * an as3 or as5 anesthesia monitor (ekg, invasive pressure, etCO2, halogenate, spirometry)
      * a Taphonius equine ventilator
      * (some ekg .csv data extracted using a Televet holter system)
